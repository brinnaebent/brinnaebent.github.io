                    <p>First, it is important to recognize that most of these devices are not currently approved for or marketed for medical purposes. While it may be in the fine print, these devices are meant for general fitness and wellness and may not be accurate in all situations.
                        We are currently working on this! (Check out our recent paper on this topic, available <a target="blank" href="https://mhealth.jmir.org/2020/12/e25137">here</a>). We showed in our study investigating sources of inaccuracy in wearable optical heart rate sensors that 
                        activity and device had an effect on accuracy.</p>

                    <p>As a consumer, it is important to be aware that these smartwatches are not medical devices. A couple things that have been shown to increase accuracy is cleaning the back of the watch regularly and wearing the watch correctly (see the guidelines of your specific smartwatch. We usually don't wear them correctly!)
